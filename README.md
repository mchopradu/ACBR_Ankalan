# ACBR_Ankalan

## Advancing Drug Discovery with Machine Learning Models for BCR-ABL, HDAC6, PARP1 and Telomerase Inhibitors.

## Description 
ACBR_Aankalan is an open-source web server designed to help with target-driven early-stage drug discovery. It uses proprietary Machine Learning classifiers to predict the bioactivity class (active or inactive) of the molecules against various cancer targets.  With its user-friendly interface , ACBR_Aankalan enables researchers to predict, conduct virtual screening, and use the tool into larger drug discovery pipelines.

ACBR_Aankalan has two types of modules for each target (BCR-ABL, HDAC6, PARP1 and Telomerase)-

# (1) Classification- For bioactivity class (active or inactive) prediction of a single compound against any of the selected target.
# (2) Virtual Screening- For bioactivity class (active or inactive) prediction of more than one compounds against any of the selected target.
