# ACBR_Ankalan

## Advancing Drug Discovery with Machine Learning Models for BCR-ABL, HDAC6, PARP1 and Telomerase Inhibitors.

This repository contains details, codes and the associated ML models of the ACBR Ankalan web-server deployed on the following link [ACBR Ankalan](https://bic.acbr.du.ac.in/ankalan) for any one to use it freely for educational andd research purpose.

## Description 
ACBR_Aankalan is an open-source web server designed to help with target-driven early-stage drug discovery. It uses proprietary Machine Learning classifiers to predict the bioactivity class (active or inactive) of the molecules against various cancer targets.  With its user-friendly interface , ACBR_Aankalan enables researchers to predict, conduct virtual screening, and use the tool into larger drug discovery pipelines.

ACBR_Aankalan has two types of modules for each target (BCR-ABL, HDAC6, PARP1 and Telomerase)-

### (1) Classification- For bioactivity class (active or inactive) prediction of a single compound against any of the selected target.
### (2) Virtual Screening- For bioactivity class (active or inactive) prediction of more than one compounds against any of the selected target.

For both modules, the prediction results are supplemented with key ADME properties, including Molecular Weight, Aromaticity, LogP, Heavy Atom Count, Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA), Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD), Total Polar Surface Area (TPSA), and Rotatable Bondsâ€”all essential characteristics for assessing a compound's drug-likeness.

The classification module also includes a Tanimoto Similarity component, which compares the predicted active compound to known active compounds in the training dataset.  This aids in the identification of the most closely related active compound, revealing further information about its potential bioactivity.

The Acbr_Ankalan repository on github is organized into two primary modules:

Classification/ â†’ Contains classification models and scripts.
Virtual_screening/ â†’ Contains virtual screening models and scripts.
Each module has separate subfolders for different targets: BCR-ABL, HDAC6, PARP1, and TELOMERASE as shown below

```bash

### Dataset

The compound datasets for these targets were obtained from [ChEMBL v33](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/), resulting in high-quality, bioactivity-annotated data for model training and validation.

## How to use it

Since it contains two modulesâ€”Classification and Virtual Screeningâ€” predictions for each target must be made independently for both modules.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Use This Repository

To run the classification and virtual screening models, you can either **clone the repository using Git** (recommended) or **manually download the files** and set up the folder structure.

### **âœ… Option 1: Clone the Repository Using Git (Recommended)**
This method ensures you have all necessary files in the correct structure.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mchopradu/Acbr_Ankalan.git
cd Acbr_Ankalan

```

### **âœ… Option 2: Downloading the files manually**
If downloading the files manually, go to the repository and click "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP file on your computer.


**To run the prediction module, make folders and sub-folders like this**-

```bash

Acbr_Ankalan/classification/
â”œâ”€â”€ BCR-ABL/
â”œâ”€â”€ HDAC6/
â”œâ”€â”€ PARP1/
â”œâ”€â”€ TELOMERASE/

Place model files (.joblib, .pkl etc ) inside their respective subfolders.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
env\\Scripts\\activate    # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

From the Acbr_Ankalan main folder, run the classification script as shown in the example below:

python acbr_ankalan_cls.py --target BCR-ABL --smiles "Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccc(CN3CCN(C)CC3)cc2)cc1Nc1nccc(-c2cccnc2)n1"

Replace BCR-ABL with HDAC6, PARP1, or TELOMERASE and smiles as needed.

```

**Similarly, to perform virtual screening, make folders and sub-folders as follows-**

```bash

Acbr_Ankalan/virtual_screening/
â”œâ”€â”€ BCR-ABL/
â”œâ”€â”€ HDAC6/
â”œâ”€â”€ PARP1/
â”œâ”€â”€ TELOMERASE/

Place model files (.joblib, .pkl etc ) inside their respective subfolders.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
env\\Scripts\\activate    # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

From the Acbr_Ankalan main folder, run the virtual_screening script as shown in the example below:

python acbr_ankalan_vs.py --target BCR-ABL --file input_smiles.csv

For Virtual_Screening module, upload a CSV file with following format--- SMILES (1st column) and id (2nd column)

Replace BCR-ABL with HDAC6, PARP1, or TELOMERASE and smiles as needed.
