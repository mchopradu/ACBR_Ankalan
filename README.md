# ACBR_Ankalan

Advancing Drug Discovery with Machine Learning Models for BCR-ABL, PARP1, HDAC6, and Telomerase Inhibitors.

ACBR Aankalan is an open-source web server designed to help with target-driven early-stage drug discovery. It uses proprietary Machine Learning classifiers to predict the bioactivity class (active or inactive) of the molecules against various cancer targets.  With its user-friendly interface , ACBR Aankalan enables researchers to predict, conduct virtual screening, and use the tool into larger drug discovery pipelines.
